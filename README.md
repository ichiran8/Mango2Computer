# Mango2 Computer Emulator
Our FPGA emulator for the Apple II. This emulator does not have a Disk Operating System and only supports 64 KB of memory.

**DISCLAIMER** This is intended to run on the Basys3FPGA board and the NexysA7 FPGA board. All other boards will not work with the current configuration!
Also note, this will only run if you have Vivado Design Suite!.
